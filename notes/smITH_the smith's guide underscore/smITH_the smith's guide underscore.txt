consider
temp vars - g\__var
g for gone very soon ofc

normal vars - tURTLe_cASe
normal variables are like turtles. they stick around for a while, but they’re always cool

enums- \_\_xxcool\_casexx\_\_
enums r, tbh, honestly v cool and ppl do NOT give them enough credit. its is time we give them the credits.

functions - FUNCTIONS\_function\_name\_function\_#
the last word being the function name + what # function it - like how many functions you’ve made so far
its rlly cool to always see how big your project has gotten PLUS they’re automatically added to your mind-array this way
when viewing the array, you can also know what it’s for without needing to breaking the for/repeat loop just to view the array name

methods - RANDOM_SONG_LYRIC_with_method_name_randomly_in_there
similar to functions except to how they’re different, this ensures the method name will be visibly different from its surroundings
it’s also a fun way to really spice up your code, and it can even help you decide what song to listen to next

ofc, formatting is what already comes naturally to most people

```gml
var g__yes =  true
;

if   (vARIABLe =  g__yes)
{__xxcool_macroxx__  =

FUNCTIONS_function_name_function_#(  g__yes + “true” )
;}
```
